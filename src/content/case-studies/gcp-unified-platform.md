## Project Overview

Designed and implemented a unified data platform on Google Cloud Platform for a major e-commerce client, integrating BigQuery as Data Lake, Data Warehouse, and Data Mart with comprehensive orchestration and monitoring.

## Challenge

The client needed to:
- Consolidate fragmented data sources
- Improve data processing speed
- Reduce licensing and infrastructure costs
- Enable real-time analytics and ML model deployment

## Solution

### Platform Architecture
- BigQuery as unified storage and compute layer
- Cloud Composer for workflow orchestration
- Dataflow for stream and batch processing
- Cloud Functions for event-driven automation
- Pub-Sub for real-time data ingestion

### Pipeline Design
- Robust ETL with failure recovery and alerting
- Incremental processing for efficiency
- Data quality validation at each stage
- Automated monitoring and logging

### BI Migration
- Migrated from Looker to Tableau
- Optimized data models for reporting
- Self-service analytics enablement
- Cost reduction through licensing optimization

### ML Integration
- Data Science model operationalization
- Automated model deployment pipelines
- Feature store implementation
- Model monitoring and versioning

## Results

- 10x improvement in data processing speed
- $7,000 annual savings in licensing costs
- 99.9% pipeline uptime
- Reduced time-to-insight from days to hours
- Enabled real-time analytics for business users
